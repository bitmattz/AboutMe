    <string name="bio">Hello, my name is Matheus, but you can call me Matt.
    \nI love robots and science.
    \nI\'m creating a robot that shoots Nerf darts automatically when someone enters my room without my permission.
    \nIt sounds scary, but I swear it\'s for scientific purpose only (or security ðŸ¤”ðŸ¤£).
    \nAfter this, I\'ll create a replica of GLADOS based on the game Portal 2. For those who have played, it really sounds scary.
    \nI also enjoy jet engines.\n\n
